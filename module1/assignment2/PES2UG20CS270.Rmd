### Solutions

### Problem 1
df <- read.csv("top_1000_instagrammers.csv", header=TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

df$Followers <- substr(df$Followers, 1, nchar(df$Followers) - 1)
df$Authentic.Engagement <- substr(df$Authentic.Engagement, 1, nchar(df$Authentic.Engagement) - 1)
df$Engagement.Avg. <- substr(df$Engagement.Avg., 1, nchar(df$Engagement.Avg.) - 1)

df$Followers <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Followers))
df$Authentic.Engagement <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Authentic.Engagement))
df$Engagement.Avg. <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Engagement.Avg.))

print(summary(df))

##ANALYSIS: from the summary we can tell that the average engagement 
#and authentic engagement have almost similar statistics as expected. 
#There's a mean of 26M followers with maximum being approx. 530M
#My instagram has 871 followers and has authentic engagement of about 450
#which are both very small when compared with the top 1000's statistics.

### Problem 2
library(ggplot2)

total <- aggregate(df$Followers, by=df[c('Audience.Country')], FUN=sum)

ggplot(total, aes(x=Audience.Country,y=x))+ geom_bar(stat='identity') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=.5, hjust=1))

ind_follower <- total[which(total$Audience.Country == "India"),'x']
sprintf("Total number of followers for India -is %s", ind_follower)

#ANALYSIS: United states has the most amount of followers as you can see from the plotted histogram.
#India has a total of 5684M followers and is ranked second.


### Problem3
library(tidyverse)
boxplot(df$Authentic.Engagement, main="Authentic Engagement", horizontal=TRUE)

#ANALYSIS: from the box plot, we can tell that minimum engagment is 1, 
#median of about 250M, maximum of 1000M and 1st quartile at 125M while the third quartile is at 450M. 
#It also has some potential outliers after 950M.

### Conclusion
#My instagram comes under lifestyle category
# It has 871 followers and an estimated engagement of 450
#On comparing it to the top 1000 instagram accounts, mine's insignificant. 
#If I were to become an influencer, the best way to increase followers and engaments would be 
#to switch to  amore popular category and focus on the US and indian audience
